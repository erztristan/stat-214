Code Style - check the applicable boxes,"Reproducibility of report. You don't have to actually run anything, but is it clear to you based on what is in the ""code"" folder how all the figures/results in the report were produced? Would it be easy to reproduce them? If not, discuss why.

(Since I'm not asking you to run anything, I haven't provided any additional items students may have put in their ""data"" folders, but if e.g. the code refers to '../data/some-input-file.csv', pls assume it exists)",How easy would it be for you to use their code to clean the data the same way they did? Is there an easy-to-use function in a separate file?,Readability of report (Was the narrative clear and easy to read? Or did you find it hard to follow?

"Sufficient comments are included to understand code., Sufficient docstrings are included to understand APIs and functions., Consistent style is used.","The report appears to be highly reproducible, as the files are not hard-coded and the functions' doc-strings are properly filled in.","The functions are easy to use because they all have clearly specified uses, etc. However, the cleaning functions are all integrated in ""clean.py"", which has a large number of lines and a large number of variable names, so it may be better to split each function into independent "".py"" files.",It's highly readable. There are no problems.,"The process was clear and detailed, including making sure there were no values that should not occur.",Charts were appropriate and discussed in the report.,"The figures were easy to understand. In particular, it was easy to identify the contents from the figures alone, since the names of the variables were converted into an interpretable form.",The quality of the figures and tables was high and supported the author's argument.,The quality of the figures and tables was high and supported the author's argument.,"The quality of the graph was high. In particular, the fact that skull fracture results differed according to age was interesting. I was also interested in the differences between ciTBI and TBI for each age group. I think it would be better to delve deeper into the data to find out the factors behind these differences.","As a method of reality check, I think it is an appropriate approach to point out previous studies. However, as a result of the check, differences in the quality of the data sets were noted, so it was not certain how realistic the author's analysis was.","I thought the approach of perturbing a part of the data and seeing how the results change was natural, and it was discussed appropriately. I think it would be better if it was easier to see which pairs of changes were large, because there is a lot of information in the charts.","Overall, I thought the report was good."

"Sufficient comments are included to understand code., Sufficient docstrings are included to understand APIs and functions., Consistent style is used.","Yes, the figures and results are reproducible, as the report details data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling steps clearly.",It is easy.,"The report is clear and well-structured, but minor grammar issues slightly affect readability.","The data cleaning was well-documented with detailed explanations of handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.","Yes, the figures were relevant and appropriately discussed in the report, particularly in sections on data cleaning, exploration, and modeling, where they effectively illustrated key concepts and preprocessing decisions.",The figures were generally clear and included captions.,"The figure effectively illustrates differences in clinical findings and CT scan reasons across age groups. However, improving color contrast would enhance clarity.",The correlation matrix is informative.,"The figure is informative. However, improving color contrast would enhance clarity.","Yes, using Kuppermann et al., 2009 as a reality check is appropriate since it is a well-known study on pediatric TBI risk assessment.",The stability check was relevant and demonstrated robustness in key findings.,
