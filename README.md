# STAT 214

This is the GitHub repository for receiving lab assignments in STAT 214, Spring 2025.

Thanks to Anthony Ozerov, Chengzhong Ye, Theo Saarinen, Omer Ronen, James Duncan, Tiffany Tang, Zoe Vernon, Rebecca Barter, and other past STAT 215A GSI's for sharing their material with us. This document was originally written by Rebecca for STAT 215A in the Fall of 2017, has been slightly modified in subsequent years, and has been significantly modified for STAT 214.

Questions and discussions between students can be posted on Ed Discussions. That way everyone else can see your questions and the answers, and we don't have to answer the same questions a million billion times. Preferably you will answer each other's questions. It is our intention to only jump in when the question is one that only we can answer.

Please think carefully before asking questions specifically about the projects. For example, questions concerning how to do something specific in Python (e.g. "how do I format the data for linear regression in sklearn?") are fine, but questions asking what other people did for their analysis are not (e.g. "what are some findings that people have come across in the TBI project"). Questions asking about clarifications are fine.

# The Lab Assignments

There will be 3 lab reports throughout the semester (2 labs and 1 final project). These reports are a *big deal*. It is in completing these reports that the real learning happens. You will get to apply what you've learned in the lectures and labs to real datasets (with real issues). You will also learn to develop a narrative that reports your scientific findings as accurately and accessibly as possible: you will learn to tell a story with your analysis.

While you are allowed to discuss the projects with one another, each student must work on and hand in their own report. If you do consult with other students, please acknowledge these students in your lab reports.

The lab assignments will be received by pulling this repository, and then submitted through your own `stat-214` repository.
