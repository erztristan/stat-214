Group 7:

Jasmine Khamuani:
I worked on coding, analysis and interpretations for hyperparameter tuning, best hyperparameter selection in Part 1 and did complete writing for 2.2: Finetuning by LoRA and conclusion. I co-wrote 2.3 with Taiki.

Taiki Kubo:
I performed ridge regression using a pre-trained BERT model, compared it with lab3.1/3.2, and supported LoRA fine-tuning.

Tristan Erz:
I worked coding and writing for Part 2, especially on the LIME implementation and interpretations. 


Kevin Xu:
I co-wrote the SHAP code and interpreted the word-voxel patterns.
